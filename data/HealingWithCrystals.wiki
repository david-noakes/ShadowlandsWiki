The basics are that the energies are out of balance in some way, perhaps because of blockages in the meridians, wasteful practices such as indulging in drugs, sexual excess, poor diet, lack of exercise, stress and so on. 

The principal is to have the patient lie down (clothed is fine) and place one or more Crystals on one or more Chakras. You select the crystals according to their properties and the chakras according to their properties. 

Each type of crystal conducts its own type of energy, and this works toward a particular effect. Please refer to 

*the [Ailment Index] 
*the [Crystal Index] 
*the [Chakra Index] for more information . 

Each chakra has its own properties, and the combination of crystal chanelled energy works to affect the chakra in a particular manner. This can be for healing or for detriment. The crystals should be left for between ten minutes and half an hour. 

In addition, the patient can meditate on the chakras being treated, imagining the imagery associated with them, or the sounds or colors. 

One treatment should suffice for mild problems, but for more severe problems three or even seven treatments may be needed. Repeat treatments should be conducted no sooner than three days and no longer than one week from the previous treatment.
