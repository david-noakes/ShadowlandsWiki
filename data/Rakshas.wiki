++Rakshas
Rim Demons who inhabit the wasteland around the Pit of Chaos. They have abilities like tracking artifacts, but their sorcery is limited, and they tend to rely on raw power. Those fireballs can follow you through shadow, and will burn you to ash, bones and all, as you saw. They are practically impossible to kill, except for their fireballs, and the arrows of Palomedes/Herne the Hunter.
