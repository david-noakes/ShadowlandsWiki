++Ice Gods
Not to be confused with the [[TrollGods][Troll Gods]].
The Ice Gods reside in the frozen wastes behind shadow, and little is known about this region.
Gods can be banished here, where they are trapped for millenia or longer. This happened to 
[[StealerOfSouls][The Stealer of Souls]].
The Ice Gods are reputed to be hold overs from a previous cycle of the multiverse. One of them:
Myolnirr, is reputed to have crafted a number of magical artifacts. Chief amongst these are the 
so called Sun Blades such as the one carried by Danny [[EaglesGifts][The Eagle's Gifts]].
They are reputed to craft all the magical arftifacts that gods use to manifest in shadow.
