++ The Black Prince

the master of Britain.

The Black Prince was a dark haired, gaunt man of average height, with a neat black beard. He wore an expensive suit in an older style. George did not know if he really was the former Prince of Wales, Edward of Woodstock, eldest son of Edward III, an English king some time in the 1300s, or just claimed the title. He was, however, Master Vampire for almost all of Britain, with other masters blood oathed to him.

McAllister was the Black Prince’s human servant, partaking of his master’s powers, but able to go places his master could not, such as churches. McAllister was a red head, seeming about thirty, and dressed in a modern suit.
