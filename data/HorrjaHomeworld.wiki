++ Horrja Homeworld

Her planet is tropical, semi arid, gravity 0.89, sky pale yellow. Her people live in a world of deserts, monsoons, half a year of dry, half a year of wet. Most dwellings were originally carved into rocky cliffs and mountains, though now they build ziggurat shaped buildings of stone.

The homeworld of the Sand People had a lot of sand. Most of that was yellow, though some was red. It was a hot, dry world, with small lakes and seas. Many rivers flowed underground for much of their journeys. There was a brief, severe wet season, and a long dry season.

The Sand People built in stone, either on high ground, or burrowed into mountain sides. Thousands of years earlier many had lived nomadic lives, in tents, travelling from one water hole to the next. Building in stone, on higher ground, made it easier to get through the floods of the wet season. Permanent water sources allowed agriculture and civilisation. 


++++Dreaming City
This place in dreaming took as its model a city over two thousand years old, before the arrival of the Sea People. As Mirrja had hinted, most of the people here were spirits of the dead, come to spend time in familiar surroundings until time for their reincarnation. The technology here was a mishmash of different eras - animal power, steam power, and electric power.
