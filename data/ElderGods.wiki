++ Elder Gods
These beings are archetypal gods and godesses, and cannot appear in shadow without destroying
everything. They are classified by the guides as [[TheNon-BornBeings][The Non-Born Beings]]. They are also known as the Luminous Beings or Luminous Dragons from the region of the summer stars.
They create artifacts that they drop in shadow, and skilled sorcerers can build them bodies to manifest in. These artifacts include hearts, hands, eyes and so on.
