++Karma
"Karma is like heaven and hell, its an invention of the priests to keep us miserable sinners in line. Judgement is the same, except that if we expect judgement, then we will make it happen. Belief is the key. But equally, we are all dreams in the mind of god, so there is an underlying principal to the way the universe works. That principal manifests itself as 'the workings of power' as Imladril calls it. In other words, it depends on your own personal power, which you develop by diligently practicing the fundamentals of sorcery." She looked at me.
I added "There are links formed between people who are part of an interaction. What is important here is emotions and feelings. They use your own power to create a link with the other person. So if you kill someone, that other person generally has an emotional reaction that creates a link to you, and if you were fighting them at the time then you'll have some link formed with them. What that means is that you will have something to work out with each other, something like karma, that will have to be dissolved. That link will force you to confront each other again and again until the bond is dissolved, or the issue resolved. Then you can reclaim the power you expended in creating the link. So the only karmic links between people are private to the two individuals concerned, and the only judge who will admonish you for your behavior is yourself."
