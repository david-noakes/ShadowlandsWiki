+Sexual Energy
Energy is generated by the various organs of the body and flows to the appropriate chakra, but it also flows into the chakra from sources outside the body. In this case earth energy flows in through chakras situated on the feet and accumulates in the base chakra, along with the sexual energy. From here some of it flows out through the sexual organs and into your partner and her base chakra. The rest circulates up your spine and out into the chakra situated above your head. From here some flows down through your chakras to circulate again. The rest flows out and into the chakra above your partner's head and down through her chakras. The same thing happens with her energies. If you don't have a partner, or she doesn't circulate energy to you, then the energy is lost. Ever wondered why men fall asleep after sex, while women wake up? They keep the bulk of the male energy that flows out through the penis at orgasm, and don't give much back. Circulating it keeps it between the two of you, and balances male and female energies, leaving both of you in harmony and energised.

 Energy balancing has to be male-female doesn't it?

Yes, male and female energies balance. Male-male or female-female doesn't balance, it amplifies and leaves you more out of balance.

In addition is [Kundalini], raised using tantric and taoist techniques, allows the person to channel vastly more energy.
