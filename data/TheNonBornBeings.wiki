++Non--Born Beings
The Guides classify powerful beings into those born into bodies, and those that must create them in order to manifest in shadow. Some of these constitute [[LuminousDragons][The Luminous Dragons]] and the [[OldSorcerers][Old Sorcerers]]


Those born into bodies are less powerful, than the Non Born.
Consider the Greek, Roman and Egyption gods. They are all examples of beings who are born. They are powerful, but are shadows of the Non Born beings. They are also called the [Immortals]
