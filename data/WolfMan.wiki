++Wolf Man (Gray Wolf)
a tall, lean pale skinned man with dark hair, blue tattoos on his body, and pale gray eyes. He wore a tunic and kilt of leather, and a cloak made from the pelt of a gray wolf. Like the Red Raven, he wore a complicated device on his chest â€“ a hope covered with netting, and bits of fur, black feathers and colored stones tied here and there. In his left hand he carried a bone flute.
