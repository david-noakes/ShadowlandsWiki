Governor of Athens in 1715. He is canny as well as cunning, and allows influential Greeks to play a part in the administration of Athens.

The governor stood out as a richly dressed forty something, his heavy black beard neatly trimmed, and his dark eyes and long nose reminding George of an eagle. The governor wore red trousers and a green jacket with gilt buttons and military insignia
