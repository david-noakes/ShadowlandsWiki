++ Master Of Athens

Palomedes was dressed in black leather. His skin was pale, denoting his true Greek heritage, his hair and Elizabethan beard were red, and his eyes pale blue. It is likely he became a vampire in the early 1600s, but it might have been much earlier.

He is a day walker, and does not need to sleep during the day. He dresses as if he needs to protect himself from direct sunlight, but he is powerful enough not to need this. All the vampires in Athens are blood oathed to him, and he will blod oath any masterless vampire he finds. Other vampire masters are exempt, since he lacks the power to force blood oathing on them. 

In 1715 he is attempting to set up a vampire council that will range across all of europe and the middle east.
