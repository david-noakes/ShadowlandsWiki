++The Mind Of God
"Now, there are an infinite number of shadows. If you think about it, shadow implies something to cast the shadow, a light source, and something on which to cast the shadow. The substance on which the shadows are cast is the mind of god. The light which casts the shadows is the light of god. That which casts the shadows, the sources of shadow if you like, we call the archetypes. They are the dreams of god. We inhabit shadows, so we are dreams within a dream. There are probably an infinite number of archetypes, which I think would give you infinity squared shadows.
"Each dream or archetype is self consistent, it has its own rules and logic. Different dreams have different logics. Within the shadows cast by a single source, the rules are consistent those of the archetype. For example, time runs at different speeds in different shadows, explosives may not work in some shadows, but the over-all logic remains the same for all shadows of an archetype. If you go into shadows cast by a different archetype, say the archetype of water, the logic is completely different. For example, the water archetype has beings composed entirely of liquid - they could not survive in our shadows, nor could we survive in theirs.
In a sense, it is all a dream - a dream in the mind of god. God dreams the archetypes, and the archetypes dream the shadows, which in turn dream us.
