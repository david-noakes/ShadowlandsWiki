+Sir Matthias Loxton
Loxton was in his early thirties, dressed fashionably in brocade doublet, frilled Elizabethan collar, bulbous pantaloons with slashing that revealed different colored lining, heavy silk stockings and knee high boots. He wore a short red cloak and groomed beard that came to a point below his chin. His hair was fashionably shoulder length. He wore a sword.

++Background
The earl of Edgewater (Richard Loxton) and his family died of plague in the early 1300s. Retainers found a toddler they believed was the surviving son, and called him Matthias Loxton. He was brought up by one of his retainers, who trained him to read and write, as well as fight and believe as a catholic, and be loyal to the king. 

Matthias soon realised he was different - immensely strong, healing fast from any wound. He does not age past late 20s. He concocts a scheme where by he has a son, and when the son is the right age, the father dies, and Matthias assumes the identity of the son.

The names are Matthias, Aaron, Enoch and Tobias, cycling back to Matthias again. He believes he has an affinity with Methuselah. He learns he can modify his appearance, not realising he is a shape shifter.

During this time Lukeios appears in several guises to guide him. (Or Captain Nemo? Or someone else? Or a number of immortals?)
