++ Chakras

Nalini launched into a demonstration of chakras, the energy gateways for the body, starting with the conventional seven that run up the spine. “There are many more than these. The energy flowing up your spine doesn’t start at the base chakra, there’s another chakra at your feet, both feet, but by convention it’s regarded as one. There’s another above your head, from which energy flows down through your spine. Then there are the lesser ones, not part of the main flow. Two at your hands, and unlike your feet they are regarded as two. There’s another two on either side of your hips, two more on either side of your chest, and two more on either side of your head. That makes seventeen chakras, and each one can be used for different kinds of sorcery. For example the hara, the one below the navel, can be used for shape shifting. The solar plexus chakra is used for shadow walking. The third eye chakra is used for seeing auras and spirits.”
