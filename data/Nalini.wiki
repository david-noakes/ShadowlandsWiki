+++Nalini Vaidya
Nalini stands about one hundred and seventy centimeters, or five foot seven. She has a gymnast's body, and moves with a dancer's lithe grace. Her skin is the color of black coffee, her face shows a mixture of Chinese and Indian features, but her eyes are yellow like those of a cat. Her glossy black hair is sometimes worn in a single braid, sometimes in two braids, and sometimes is held in place with jewelled combs. It usually falls between half way and two thirds of the way down her back. 
She usually dresses in an emerald green T-shirt, black jeans and hiking boots. There is a single large gold hoop and a single small gold loop in each ear. About her neck is a gold torc chased with silver and red gold scrollwork that could almost be cursive runes. Each end of the torc cradles a single large gem, the left one smoky green, the right one smoky red. She also wore a gold ring set with a single large amethyst on a gold chain about her neck (see [[EaglesGifts][The Eagles Gifts]]). The ring was a gift from Finn mac Morn (the Story Fin Mac Morn [[Erehwon001][Such Stuff as Dreams are Made Of]]) . On her left hand was a white gold band incised with black runes. Danny wears its twin on his left hand. They were gifts to each other.
Nalini usually has a semi automatic pistol holstered at her right hip. The pistol is black and lethal, firing fifteen 9mm shots from a single magazine. She also has a samurai sword strapped across her back. She is quite proficient with the sword, and was taught to use it by [Durathror].
She learned shadow shifting from [Korum], whom she first met when she was only 19.
