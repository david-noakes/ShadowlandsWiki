Guides exist only in the non physical realm, which classifies them as non physical or non corporeal beings. They might be related to computer projections.
++Home Shadow
There shadow consists of an ocher colored plain, studded with crystal forms and what appear to be uluru size lumps. These are honeycombed with tunnels perhaps 40 or 50 meters across, wherein live assorted dreaming bodies performing assorted tasks.
The guides offer this as a place of safety and physical immortality, but once you decide to go there you cannot return to the physical. They seem to be in a dead end type of existance, stagnating.
++Energy
They have one of 2 energies - water or fire, and are willing to exchange energies with dreamers. There energy is lacking in emotion, but stronger and more stable than that of humans'
They claim to be as old as the universe, and that the universe is older than we expect.
