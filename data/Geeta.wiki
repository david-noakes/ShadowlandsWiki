Geeta is a native of Zeta Tucan/6, an earth like planet. Her race is referred to as ?. She is a stern looking female. Her skin is pale blue, but stippled with lighter spots and patterened with darker tiger stripes, her eyes are yellow with vertical slits like a cats, her nose is flat and broad, and she has heavy brow ridges. Her ears are somewhat pointy. She has no hair, but instead a crest of brightly colored feathers (Red, yellow, green) runs across the top of her head. She has four arms, and two large, pendulous breasts with aureoles the size of saucers. She has a heavy, muscular build, and has no body hair what so ever.
She owns the ship she captains. She lives alone in a small two bedroom apartment, with the second bedroom used for storage. The living area has a large piped image of the planet Saturn down below, and two images of her home world.
