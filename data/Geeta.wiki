++Geeta
Geeta is the captain of a salvage ship working out of Saturn Station. She is called upon to rescue the Starship Falcon, which has an experimental warp drive. When we first meet her she is wearing a utilitarian one piece uniform and soft boots.
Geeta is a native of HD219077 - Tucana G8(95.2LY)/6.2, (in the stories Tucana G8.177.6.2) an earth like planet orbitting a gas giant. Her race refers to itself as Sea People. She is a stern looking female. Her skin is pale blue, but stippled with lighter spots and patterened with darker tiger stripes, her eyes are yellow with vertical slits like a cats, her nose is flat and broad, and she has heavy brow ridges. Her ears are somewhat pointy. She has no hair, but instead a crest of brightly colored feathers (Red, yellow, green) runs across the top of her head. She has four arms, and two large, pendulous breasts with aureoles the size of saucers. She has a heavy, muscular build, and has no body hair what so ever.
She owns the ship she captains. She lives alone in a small two bedroom apartment, with the second bedroom used for storage. The living area has a large piped image of the planet Saturn down below, and two images of her home world.
