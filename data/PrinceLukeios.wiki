+Prince Lukeios of Stygia

He wore loose yellow pantaloons that came to mid calf, leather sandals with gold buckles, a lavender jerkin, a leather belt with a large golden buckle, a yellow military style jacket with purple swatches, gold braid, gold buttons set with amethysts. Around his neck was a heavy golden torc. His face was clean shaven, his black hair short and curly. His nose was sharp and curved, his eyes a brilliant yellow.

"Greetings gentleman, I bid you welcome." His voice was mellifluous, warm and deep. "I am Prince Lukeios of Stygia, my titles include 'The hawk that soars at dawn' and 'The Herald of the Sun'. Please be seated. Would you like a drink? I can offer fresh green tea, Persian style coffee which my assistant is making, wine, porter or something you English call sherry."

He carried with him an aura of power that made people want to cringe in fear.
