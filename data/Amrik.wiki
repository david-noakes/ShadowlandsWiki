++Amrik (King)
Shadow: [Aquilonia]

King Amrik is a tall man (about 6' 4" or about 193cm) with the muscles of a body builder. His black hair is usually cropped short, though in the past he let it grow to his shoulders. His eyes are icy blue, and he is clean shaven. His skin is pale, and he looks about thirty. He usually affects the simple dress of an army officer: baggy crimson breeches, knee high black boots, a lace fronted white shirt with a mandarin collar, and a sky blue jacket with gold piping and buttons. Sometimes he wears the black and gold uniform of the palace guard. The only give-away is that the high Prussian-style collar bears a stylized bull's head on each side, worked in gold. A gold torc similar to the ones we wear can be seen peeking from his open collar. He looks civilized, possibly effete, because underneath the clothing his muscles could be mistaken for fat. The one incongruous note is a heavy broadsword with a black two-handed hilt and a worn dark green scabbard that is usually strapped to his waist on the left hand side. I can use that sword two-handed though it is a little heavy, Amrik is strong enough to wield it with one.

Amrik came to power at the end of the [[AquiloniaCivilWar][Civil War in Aquilonia]].
