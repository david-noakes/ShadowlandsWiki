Ottoman turks invaded Greece from about 1460 to about 1571, and controlled it until 1821. In may 1811, George returned home to his village to discover it burning, his wife and children mutilated and dead. He fled to the woods, and met a band of freedom fighters. They were vampires, who converted him into one.
