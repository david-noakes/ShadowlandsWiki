++ George

George the vampire looks about 30. He is average height (1.75m = 5'9"), has dark brown eyes, shoulder length black hair, Greek complexion. Always dresses in black. Accomplished martial artist, also knives, swords and cane.

Ottoman turks invaded Greece from about 1460 to about 1571, and controlled it until 1821. In may 1811, George returned home to his village to discover it burning, his wife and children mutilated and dead. He fled to the woods, and met a band of freedom fighters. They were vampires, who converted him into one.

They killed many Turks, but later the small band of vampires preyed on their fellow Greeks, killing them. George killed the vampires, then fled, working his way from Greece across Europe, until he arrived in England before world war one.
