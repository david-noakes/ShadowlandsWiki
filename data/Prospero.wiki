++Prospero (Duke)
*Shadow:* [Aquilonia]
Prospero is about my height, slim and wiry. Like me his hair is brown and his eyes blue. He often wears the uniform of an officer in the king's guard: in baggy red trousers, sky blue jerkin, soft boots of brown leather.
His formal title is Duke, and he is second in command of the armed forces. Since King Amrik has no children yet, Prospero is his designated heir.
His house colors are Red, Yellow and Black.
Prospero is an excellent swordsman. He is also a connoisseur of fine food, wine, art and horses. In addition he has a fascination for new technology.
