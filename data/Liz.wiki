++Liz -- Liz Bardon
Shadow: [BrisbaneShadow]
Liz is a Murri aboriginal, someone we originally hired as a sort of girl friday, but who wound up sharing an adventure with us. Now she is our apprentice, if you will. She stands about five feet six inches tall, say about one hundred sixty seven centimeters, with brown skin and eyes, and is somewhat more solidly built than Nalini. She has heavy brow and broad nose, and her face is round. Appearances can be deceiving however: she works out, and is learning martial arts. Her shoulder length black hair had a vivid red streak through it. Each of her ears sported four or five small earrings, and she was also wearing dark red lipstick, mostly eaten away, and eyeshadow. She was not quite wearing her colors of red and black, instead sporting faded blue jeans and a red wind cheater with a large eagle's head on the front.
Boyfriend [Palomedes] whom she first meets just before [[Erehwon007][Demon Thy Name Is Human]].
She first appears in [[Erehwon002][The Shadow of the Serpent]] at the end.
